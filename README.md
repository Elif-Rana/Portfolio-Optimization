# Portfolio-Optimization

This project was developed to explore and apply various artificial intelligence algorithms to the problem of portfolio optimization, with the goal of constructing optimal asset allocations that balance risk and return. The project focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different heuristic and AI-based approaches, namely Genetic Algorithms (GA), Hill Climbing (HC), and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

This study enables the project not only to optimize performance metrics like the Sharpe Ratio, but also to reflect practical investment considerations that are essential for realistic portfolio construction incorporating real-world constraints such as asset diversification requirements, and sector exposure rules through the use of CSP.
